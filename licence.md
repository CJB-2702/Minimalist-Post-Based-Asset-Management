<https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0>

## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree
to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all
your licenses.

## Copyright License

The licensor grants you a copyright license for the
software to do everything you might do with the software
that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright
in it for any permitted purpose.  However, you may
only distribute the software according to [Distribution
License](#distribution-license) and make changes or new works
based on the software according to [Changes and New Works
License](#changes-and-new-works-license).

## Distribution License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license
to distribute copies of the software.  Your license
to distribute covers distributing the software with
changes and new works permitted by [Changes and New Works
License](#changes-and-new-works-license).

## Notices

You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of
the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the
URL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines
beginning with `Required Notice:` that the licensor provided
with the software.  For example:

> Required Notice: Copyright Yoyodyne, Inc. (http://example.com)

## Changes and New Works License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to
make changes and new works based on the software for any
permitted purpose.

## Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that
covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able
to license, that you would infringe by using the software.

## Noncommercial Purposes

Any noncommercial purpose is a permitted purpose.

## Personal Uses

Personal use for research, experiment, and testing for
the benefit of public knowledge, personal study, private
entertainment, hobby projects, amateur pursuits, or religious
observance, without any anticipated commercial application,
is use for a permitted purpose.

## Noncommercial Organizations

Use by any charitable organization, educational institution,
public research organization, public safety or health
organization, environmental protection organization,
or government institution is use for a permitted purpose
regardless of the source of funding or obligations resulting
from the funding.

## Fair Use

You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the
law. These terms do not limit them.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply
any other licenses.

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If
your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends
immediately for work on behalf of your company.

## Violations

The first time you are notified in writing that you have
violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software
not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless
continue if you come into full compliance with these terms,
and take practical steps to correct past violations, within
32 days of receiving notice.  Otherwise, all your licenses
end immediately.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without
any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable
to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use
or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***

## Definitions

The **licensor** is the individual or entity offering these
terms, and the **software** is the software the licensor makes
available under these terms.

**You** refers to the individual or entity agreeing to these
terms.

**Your company** is any legal entity, sole proprietorship,
or other kind of organization that you work for, plus all
organizations that have control over, are under the control of,
or are under common control with that organization.  **Control**
means ownership of substantially all the assets of an entity,
or the power to direct its management and policies by vote,
contract, or otherwise.  Control can be direct or indirect.

software under these terms.

**Use** means anything you do with the software requiring one
of your licenses.






**Addendum to PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0**

1. Expansion of Permitted Purpose (Internal Use): > Notwithstanding the "Noncommercial Purposes" section of the primary license, "Permitted Purpose" is expanded to include your company’s Internal Business Use. This includes installation, execution, and use of the software by your employees and contractors for internal operations, development, and testing.

2. Commercial Service Prohibition: > Internal Business Use does not include using the software to provide a service (such as SaaS, API access, or managed hosting) to third parties, nor does it allow the use of the software to generate outputs for sale to third parties.

3. Complete Revocation of Distribution: > The "Distribution License" section of the primary license is revoked in its entirety. You may not redistribute, sub-license, or make the software available to any third party (including via a public repository or fork) without a separate Commercial License.

4. No Modification Distribution: > While the "Changes and New Works License" allows you to modify the software for internal use, you may not distribute those changes or new works to any third party.

5. Precedence: > In the event of a conflict between this Addendum and the PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0, the terms of this Addendum shall prevail.

Contributions: By submitting any changes, bug fixes, or new features to this project (e.g., via a Pull Request), you agree that your contributions are licensed under these same terms (PolyForm NC 1.0.0 + Addendum).





🌿 A Note for the Community & Open Source
I love the spirit of open source and I’m generally very open to people forking the code, experimenting with it, or contributing back to the project!

However, because this is a custom license designed to prevent commercial exploitation, the "Distribution License" is technically disabled by default. >
If you want to fork the repo or share a modified version:

Please ask first: Just shoot me a quick email or open an Issue on the repository.

The Goal: I usually grant permission for educational, hobbyist, or community-driven forks as long as they aren't being used to circumvent the commercial restrictions.

Contributions: Pull requests are always welcome and appreciated!






Commercial Licensing & Inquiries
If you or your company wish to use, redistribute, or commercialize this software in a manner not permitted by this license or its addendums (e.g., as part of a paid product, SaaS offering, or for external distribution), a separate commercial license is required.
